Udacity XYZReader - Project 5 - Make your app Material

# Project Overview

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

# Why this Project?

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

# Improvements Made:

 - App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types
   (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
 - App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
 - App theme extends from AppCompat.
 - App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
 - App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
 - App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other
   elements specified in the Material Design specification.
 - App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme
   does not impact usability of the app.
 - App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
 - App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
 - App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are
   complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
